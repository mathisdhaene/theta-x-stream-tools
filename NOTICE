This repository contains code and ideas derived from / inspired by:

- RICOH API: libuvc-theta and libuvc-theta-sample
  https://github.com/ricohapi/libuvc-theta
  https://github.com/ricohapi/libuvc-theta-sample

- thetauvc helper code by K. Takeo (BSD-style license header preserved in the source files)

This repo does NOT bundle libuvc-theta itself. Users must install Ricoh's patched libuvc
to enable H.264 over UVC for RICOH THETA devices.
